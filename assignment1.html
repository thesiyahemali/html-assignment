      ANS:
         Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add <audio> and <video> elements to the page;
         make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them <source> elements so that browsers will find the audio
         format they support best and load it. 

         The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

         The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

         The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
