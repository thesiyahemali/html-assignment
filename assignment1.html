 HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail. 
 HTML tag starts with < and ends with > Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements.

 3.What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

 ANS:
  A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances.
  Void elements can have attributes. The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML : 
  area , base , br , col , command , embed , hr , img , input , keygen , link , meta , param , source , track , wbr.

  Example:
  <html>

    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name...">    
  </body>
  </html> 
  

  4.What are HTML Entities? With Example.

  ANS:
   Some characters are reserved in HTML.
   If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
   Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

   Example:
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <body>
   
   <h1>HTML Entity Example</h1>
   <h2>A space character: &nbsp;</h2>
   <h2>The less-than sign: &lt;</h2>
   <h2>The greater-than sign: &gt;</h2>
   <h2>The ampersand (and) sign: &amp;</h2>
   <h2>The double quote sign: &quot;</h2>

   </body>
   </html>

   5.What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.

   ANS:
   .unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order.
   .ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order.
   .Description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions.

   Example:
   <!-- unordered list -->
   <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ordered list  -->
  <ol>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- Description list -->
  <dl>
    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dt>Milk</dt>
    <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  </dl>

  6.What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.

  ANS:
  The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.
  The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
  However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.

  Example:
  <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    h1.intro {
      color: blue;
    }
    
    p.important {
      color: green;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1 class="intro">Header 1</h1>
    <p class="important">header2</p>
    
    </body>
    </html>

    7.What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
    elements? With Example.

    ANS:
     Remember the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements,
     while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.

     Example:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
     <style>
     
     #myHeader {
       background-color: lightblue;
       color: black;
       padding: 40px;
       text-align: center;
     }
     
     
     .city {
       background-color: tomato;
       color: white;
       padding: 10px;
     } 
     </style>
     </head>
     <body>
     
     
     <h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>
     
     <h2 class="city">London</h2>
     <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
     
     <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
     <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
     
     <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
     <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
     
     </body>
     </html>

     8.• What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

     ANS:
      <b> - Bold text
     <strong> - Important text
     <i> - Italic text
     <em> - Emphasized text
     <mark> - Marked text
     <small> - Smaller text
     <del> - Deleted text
     <ins> - Inserted text
     <sub> - Subscript text
     <sup> - Superscript text

     9.How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.
     
     ANS:
     Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present in it. Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells.
     One can create it using the tag of HTML <table>, but it sets the type attribute to cellpadding.

    Example:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    
    th, td {
      padding: 15px;
    }
    table {
      border-spacing: 30px;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h2>Cellpadding</h2>
    <p>Cell padding specifies the space between the cell content and its borders.</p>
    
    <table border="3" style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Firstname</th>
        <th>Lastname</th> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jill</td>
        <td>Smith</td>
      </tr>
     
      <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>Doe</td>
        
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Cellspacing</h2>
    <p>Change the space between the cells with the border-spacing property.</p>
    
    <table  border="3"style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Firstname</th>
        <th>Lastname</th> 
        
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jill</td>
        <td>Smith</td>
        
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Eve</td>
        <td>Jackson</td>
        
      </tr>
    </table>
  
    10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
    table? With Example

    ANS:
    We use the colspan and rowspan attribute, to merge cells in HTML. The rowspan attribute is for the number of rows a cell should merge,
    whereas the colspan attribute is for the number of columns a cell should merge. The attribute should be placed inside the <td> tag.

    ANS:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <style>
          table,tr,th,td {
             border:1px solid black;
          }
       </style>
    <body>
       <h2>Tables in HTML</h2>
       <table style="width: 100%">
          <tr>
             <th >First Name </th>
             <th>Job role</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td >Tharun</td>
             <td rowspan="2">Content writer</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td >Akshaj</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td colspan="2">Welcome to the company</td>
          </tr>
       </table>

       11.What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

       ANS:
       A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
       A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
       Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

       An inline element does not start on a new line.
       An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
       This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
 
        Example:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
            <!-- block-level element -->
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
          <!-- inline element -->
        <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
        </body>
        </html>
       </body>
       </html>

      12.How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example

       ANS:
      HTML links are hyperlink You can click on a link and jump to another document.
      When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

     Example:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>
     <h1>HTML Links</h1>
     <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>
     </body>
     </html>

     13.What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example

     ANS:
     The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
     An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

    Example:
         <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
         <body>
         
         <h1>The iframe element</h1>
         
         <iframe src="https://www.w3schools.com" title="W3Schools Free Online Web Tutorials">
         </iframe>
         
         </body>
         </html>
 
         14.What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

         ANS:
         The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
        The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

         example:<!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
         <body>
         
         <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

        15.How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.

      ANS:
       a background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.
       To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property

     example:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>
     
     <h2>Background Image</h2>
     
     <p>A background image for a p element:</p>
     
     <p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">
     You can specify background images<br>
     for any visible HTML element.<br>
     In this example, the background image<br>
     is specified for a p element.<br>
     By default, the background-image<br>
     will repeat itself in the direction(s)<br>
     where it is smaller than the element<br>
     where it is specified. (Try resizing the<br>
     browser window to see how the<br>
     background image behaves.
     </p>    
     </body>
     </html>

     16.How are active links different from normal links?

     ANS:
      Those that don't have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link. Some browser
      recognize active links when the mouse cursor is placed over that link. Others recognize active links 
      when the link has the focus.Those that do not have mouse cursor over the link is said to be normal link.

     SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format.
     SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript). SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM
     You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element. In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object

     19.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

     ANS:
     HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML.

      ANS:
         Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add <audio> and <video> elements to the page;
         make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them <source> elements so that browsers will find the audio
         format they support best and load it. 

         The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

         The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

        Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

        Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, 
          header, and footer. 
            <article>
            <aside>

          4.Canvas and SVG tags

          ANS:

            The <svg> tag defines a container for SVG graphics. 
            SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.   
            
            Definition and Usage. The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The <canvas> tag is transparent, 
            and is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
